# Anomaly-Detection-In-Industrial-Control-Systems

## Overview

Automation plays a crucial role in enhancing cost efficiency, service quality, and the safe operation of critical assets. This project focuses on the application of anomaly detection methods for intrusion detection in the context of supervisory control systems used in electric power grids, public water utilities, and smart transportation networks. The integration of computation, networking, and physical processes in these systems poses challenges, particularly in addressing cybersecurity threats and minimizing the risk of cascading effects due to advanced persistent threats.

## Objectives
- Explore anomaly-detection-based intrusion detection methods for cyber situational awareness.
- Enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructure by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.
- Contribute to the development of methods that ensure the safe and reliable operation of automated control processes.

## Challenges

1. **Imperfect Data:**
   - Address faults in time series data, such as missing or corrupted values.
     
2. **Precision-Recall Balance:**
   - Strike a balance between precision and recall, aiming to reduce the false alarm rate for practical anomaly detection in real-world scenarios with resource constraints.

## Key Components

1. **Anomaly Detection Algorithms:**
   - Implement and evaluate various anomaly detection algorithms suitable for time series data. This includes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Employ robust data preprocessing techniques to handle missing or corrupted values. Utilize feature engineering techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance the accuracy of the HMM.

5. **Performance Metrics:**
   -  Evaluate the effectiveness of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using log-likelihood as a key metric to assess its predictive capabilities and anomaly detection accuracy.
